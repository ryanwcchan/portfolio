            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
            Growing up, I have always loved building and creating things. From
            piecing together my own Lego creations to assembling computers with
            my dad and rendering my first 3D animation with Blender, I loved to
            learn and create things using technology. I played a lot of flash
            games when I was a kid, and I started learning Java and C# because
            of I wanted to create my own games. In high school, I immersed
            myself in computer science and computer technology classes, where I
            built basic games using Java, and PC building further cementing my
            love for technology.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
            When it was time to choose a career path in university, I considered
            pursuing game development but ultimately decided to major in
            Information Technology. While I was uncertain about which specific
            career to pursue, I knew that my passion for technology would guide
            me. This decision opened doors to new opportunities and broadened my
            skill set beyond game development.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-white leading-relaxed">
            Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing a career as a software developer, with a
            focus on web development. I dedicate my free time to learning and
            refining my development skills through both formal education and
            self-study.
